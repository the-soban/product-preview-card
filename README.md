## My process

### **Built with**

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### **What I learned **

- How to use media queries.
- How to use the flexbox's row or column axis.
- Usage of rem unit in CSS.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {}
```
```css
 #container{
   display: flex;
   flex-direction: row;
    }
```
```css
.title{
      font-family: 'Fraunces';
      font-size: 2.3rem;
      line-height: 2.0rem;
    }
```

### **Continued development**

- I am still learning best practices to implement media queries, since the webpage is not fully responsive yet.
- It does show the mobile version on a smaller screen but on some of the screen breakpoints the layout turns into a mess.



### **Useful resources**

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me in understanding syntax and usage of media queries. The examples provided alongwith the documentation cleared out some confusions I had.
